# SCSCC SuperColliderSizeCodingClub

#### Manifesto

SC in SCSynth is for SizeCoding, C in SuperCollider is for Caring, the S for Sharing.
Celebrating all the ruckus accomplishable with SuperCollider in 256 characters or less. Over 256 only ok if it generates truly exceptional sounds.

* No SC3Plugins, it should run on a vanilla SuperCollider with default settings.
* If the numWireBufs or blockSize of the server needs to be altered it should be set in the program.
